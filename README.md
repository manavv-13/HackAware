This is a Data Breach Simulation Software Project.
It contains various Data Breach Scenario Simulations.
A user can run a simulation which will take them through various scenarios and user will be presented with 2 choices per scenario to choose.
At the end of the simulation, user will be presented with the result where he/she can check which decisions were wrong and corresponding preventive measures.
Thank you!
